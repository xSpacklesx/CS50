            There is an ancient legend of a Nuclear Throne.  The legend begins with a single mutant, known as the proto mutant, it is said traveled the wastes until he found The Palace. This fortress, heavily guarded by beings of pure radiation, housed the throne. The throne is said to be the only way to stabilize the world once again, and The Proto Mutant had found it!  But he hasn't been seen since, and the world certaintly hasn't been stabalized.  Now it is up to you to travel the wastes and find the Throne.
